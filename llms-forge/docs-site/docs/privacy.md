# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: January 15, 2026*

## Overview

LLMs Forge ("we", "our", or "the service") is committed to protecting your privacy. This policy explains how we handle information when you use our service.

## What We Collect

### Information We Do NOT Collect

- We do not store any URLs you submit
- We do not store extracted documentation content
- We do not require account creation
- We do not use cookies for tracking
- We do not sell any data to third parties

### Information We May Collect

- **Anonymous analytics**: We may use privacy-respecting analytics to understand general usage patterns (page views, feature usage)
- **Server logs**: Standard web server logs may temporarily contain IP addresses for security purposes

## How It Works

1. You submit a URL
2. Our server fetches the llms.txt file from that URL
3. Content is processed and returned to your browser
4. Nothing is stored on our servers after the response is sent

## Third-Party Services

The documentation you extract comes directly from third-party websites. We have no control over their content or privacy practices.

## Data Security

All communications use HTTPS encryption. We do not store personal data, so there is minimal data to protect.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect personal data:
- There's nothing to delete
- There's nothing to export
- There's nothing to correct

## Open Source

LLMs Forge is open source. You can inspect the code at [github.com/nirholas/lyra-tool-discovery](https://github.com/nirholas/lyra-tool-discovery) to verify these claims.

## Changes

We may update this policy occasionally. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated date.
