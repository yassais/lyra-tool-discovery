## What is llms.txt?

Many documentation sites now provide their content in a machine-readable format at `/llms.txt` or `/llms-full.txt`. This emerging standard makes it easy for AI assistants to access and understand documentation.

LLMs Forge simply makes this content more accessible and organized for you.
